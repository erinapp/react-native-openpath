# Openpath React Native Wrapper

Documentation is generated automatically from the comments and declarations in [index.d.ts], using [Typedoc](https://typedoc.org) with a command like so:

```shell
yarn docs
```

which puts the documentation in the `docs` directory. You can use [index.d.ts] directly to reference documentation during development
