/**
 ## Adding the SDK to your project

 **NOTE:** First follow the steps to add the iOS and Android SDKs (documented separately).

 We provide the React Native SDK in a `.zip` file. To get started:

 * Unzip it into a known location
 * From the root of your React Native project, run the following command:
 ```
 yarn add file:</path/to/the/sdk>
 ```
 filling in the actual path to the extracted `.zip` file.

 ## For iOS, change these settings in your `ios/Podfile`:

 * Disable Flipper
 * Enable `use_frameworks!`

 ## Usage

 ```javascript
 import * as ReactNativeOpenpath from 'react-native-openpath';

 // ...
 ReactNativeOpenpath.init(); // Call this once at startup.
 // ...
 ReactNativeOpenpath.provision(setupMobileToken);
 // etc..
 ```

 ### Subscribing to events

 ```javascript
 subscription = ReactNativeOpenpath.OpenpathEventEmitter.addListener(
 'OpenpathEvent',
 callback,
 );
 ```

 Refer to the reference documentation below for the available functions and events.


 > **Please note:** Although many of the code examples are in Typescript, you may use either JavaScript or Typescript to build your app.

 ------------------

 # React Native Sample App

 The React Native Sample App uses the Openpath Mobile Access Core SDK to:

 - Provision one or more user mobile credentials onto the app
 - Switch between users on the app
 - View the list of entries that the user has access to
 - Unlock an entry
 - Unprovision all the users or select one to unprovision from the list of inactive users

 For the purposes of this demo, we allow provisioning two different ways.

 1. The app can be provisioned via email and password, allowing a user to log in and generate their own mobile setup token to use for provisioning. Usually, only a user with admin rights to the Openpath Control Center (admin portal) has a password.

 2. The app can be provisioned via mobile setup token. In practice, most users won't have an Openpath password. We recommend that you create a service user (super admin) in the Openpath Control Center, and use that service user in your cloud to make Openpath API calls to generate a temporary mobile setup token for a particular user's mobile credential. Then this token should be passed from your cloud server to the mobile app and into the "provision" SDK function.

 For more information on the provisioning workflow, please refer to the Openpath Mobile Access SDK README section entitled "Provisioning Workflow".

 ## Building the Sample App

 The `reactNativeSampleApp` uses React Native version 0.73.4, which requires Node.js version 18 or higher. We recommend using [nodenv](https://github.com/nodenv/nodenv) to manage multiple Node.js versions. You may need to run `npm install -g yarn` after installing the required Node.js version.

 For both platforms:

 * Copy the iOS and/or Android SDK release into a location where the sample app can find it.
 * Run `yarn` in the root directory of the sample app.


 ### iOS

 * Update `ios/Podfile` to point to the directory where "OpenpathMobile.podspec" is located
 * Ensure you have Ruby version 2.6.10 or greater. We recommend using [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv) to manage multiple Ruby versions.
 * Run `bundle install` in the root directory
 * Run `bundle exec pod install` in the `ios` directory.
 * NOTE: This Podfile uses [cocoapods-patch](https://github.com/doublesymmetry/cocoapods-patch) to work around an incompatibility between the version of AWS libraries that Openpath uses, and the latest version of React Native. This requirement will be removed in the future. If you follow these instructions the patch will be applied automatically.
 * Open the workspace in Xcode and run the app

 ### Android

 * Copy openpath-mobile-access-core.aar into the `reactNativeSample/android/openpath-mobile-access-core` directory.
 *
